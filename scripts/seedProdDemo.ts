The stand would operate on a cooperative model with shared costs for insurance, signage, and a simple point-of-sale system. This gives residents more access to local food and gives farmers a low-barrier sales outlet beyond Saturday mornings.",

    description:
      "A proposal to build a public concrete skate park in Floyd County, giving youth and residents of all ages a dedicated space for skateboarding, scootering, and inline skating.\n\nFloyd County currently has no public skate facility. Young people who skate often use parking lots, sidewalks, and building ledges — which creates friction with business owners and safety concerns for everyone. A purpose-built park solves this while creating a positive community gathering space.\n\nProposed location: The open lot adjacent to the County Recreation Park on Route 8, which is county-owned and already has parking and restroom access.\n\nEstimated cost: $180,000–$250,000 for a 6,000 sq ft concrete park with a mix of street and transition features. Comparable rural Virginia parks (Giles County, Craig County) were built in this range.\n\nFunding approach:\n- Tony Hawk Foundation / Built to Play grant (up to $25,000)\n- Virginia Land Conservation Foundation or DCR recreational access grant\n- County capital improvement budget allocation\n- Community fundraising and in-kind labor\n\nDesign process: We'd like to work with a professional skate park designer (e.g., Spohn Ranch or American Ramp Company) who involves local skaters in the design. This ensures the park actually gets used and reflects what the community wants.\n\nThis project page is for gathering community support, sharing updates, and coordinating volunteers as the idea moves forward.",
