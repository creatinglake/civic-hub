# TESTING.md — Civic Hub Test Coverage Tracker

Updated alongside HANDOFF.md after every session that adds or modifies features.

---

## Testing Principles

1. **Tests ship with the feature.** Every slice that adds or changes user-facing behavior must include corresponding tests before the slice is considered complete.
2. **Test behavior, not implementation.** Tests describe what a resident or admin experiences. They should survive refactors and only break when something is actually wrong.
3. **One flow per test, with a clear name.** Test names read like sentences: `"resident can cast a vote on an active process"`. When a test fails, the name alone tells you what's broken.
4. **Cover the sad paths.** Voting on a closed process, submitting with missing fields, double-voting, hitting admin routes without auth — these are the bugs that slip past visual checks.
5. **Seed data is infrastructure.** Deterministic fixtures shared across API and E2E tests. Treat them like code.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
cd civic-hub

# API integration tests (requires dev server running on :3000)
npm run test

# E2E browser tests (auto-starts backend + frontend if not running)
npm run test:e2e

# E2E with visible browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# E2E with Playwright UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Watch mode for API tests during development
npm run test:watch
```

---

## Two Test Layers

### API Integration Tests (Vitest)
Hit the Express backend directly via fetch, no browser. Fast, high coverage.

- **Location:** `civic-hub/tests/api/`
- **Run:** `npm run test`
- **Config:** `civic-hub/vitest.config.ts`
- **Helpers:** `civic-hub/tests/fixtures/helpers.ts`
- **Covers:** process CRUD, event feed, auth flow, proposals, search, health/discovery, cron endpoints, deliberation routes

### E2E User Flow Tests (Playwright)
Open the real UI in Chromium and simulate resident interactions.

- **Location:** `civic-hub/tests/e2e/`
- **Run:** `npm run test:e2e`
- **Config:** `civic-hub/playwright.config.ts`
- **Covers:** critical user journeys — navigation, feed, votes, search, conversations
- **Note:** Each test dismisses the intro popup via localStorage before running.

## Flow Coverage Inventory

Each row tracks a user flow, which layer covers it, and which slice introduced it.

## How to Update This File

After each slice:

1. If the slice adds a new user flow, add a row to the appropriate table.
2. If you wrote tests for the flow, mark the API and/or E2E columns with :white_check_mark:.
3. If a flow exists but has no test yet, leave the columns blank and note "Needs test".
4. Flag any flows that were manually verified but not yet automated.

The goal: before any push to `main`, every row in this table should have at least one checkmark.

---

## Test Infrastructure Notes

- **Auth in tests:** Uses `CIVIC_DEMO_BYPASS_CODE=000000` (set in `.env`). Test helpers sign in by calling `/auth/request-code` then `/auth/verify` with the bypass code.
- **Intro popup in E2E:** Each test sets `localStorage.setItem("seen_intro_popup", "true")` before interacting with the page to prevent the intro dialog from blocking clicks.
- **File parallelism disabled:** Vitest runs test files sequentially (`fileParallelism: false`) because they share a dev server and database.
- **Playwright auto-starts servers:** The Playwright config includes `webServer` entries for both the backend (:3000) and frontend (:5173). If they're already running, it reuses them.
