// processLifecycle.ts — the pure lifecycle DECISIONS of the process service.
//
// processService.ts is mostly DB orchestration + delegation to registry
// handlers; the parts that carry real risk are the small status/lifecycle
// rules it applies along the way. Phase 5 (audit §5) extracts those rules here
// — framework-free, DB-free, exhaustively testable — the same pattern the
// codebase already uses for transitions.ts / methods.ts / deadline.ts /
// feedActivity.ts. processService imports these so the rule and its test
// share one definition.
