// civic.announcement process handler — thin adapter around the module.
//
// Announcements are not driven through the generic /process/:id/action
// dispatcher. The admin HTTP surface (/announcement/*) orchestrates the
// create / edit lifecycle directly via the module's service functions.
// This adapter exists so announcements live in the same process store
// and register as a known process type for discovery / feed rendering.
