// civic.vote_results process handler — thin adapter around the
// civic.vote_results module.
//
// The handler registers `civic.vote_results` as a process type so
// vote-results records are stored in the same process store as votes
// and proposals. Vote-results are not exposed through the generic
// `POST /process/:id/action` dispatcher — their admin surface is
// `/admin/vote-results/*`. This adapter therefore accepts no actions;
// it exists to give the registry a way to initialize state and produce
// read models for vote-results alongside other process types.
//
// Renamed from `briefProcess.ts` in Slice 8.5. Behavior is unchanged
// beyond the rename + the new vote_context snapshot input fields.
