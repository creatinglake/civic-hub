  return `You are extracting a structured list of government meetings from an agendas-and-minutes page.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (apply before anything else):
- Produce AT MOST 50 entries in the output array. If the page contains more, return only the most recent 50.
- Honor the date and content restrictions stated in <admin_instructions> below. If the admin's instructions say to exclude meetings before a date, do not include them — not as placeholders, not as null entries, not at all.
- Output nothing but the JSON array. No commentary, no preamble, no "Here are the entries:".

${instructionsBlock(input.extraction_instructions)}

<source_url>${input.source_url}</source_url>

<trimmed_html>
${input.trimmed_html}
</trimmed_html>

For each meeting entry visible on the page, extract:
- meeting_title: short human-readable name (e.g. "Board of Supervisors Regular Meeting", "Budget Workshop"). Do NOT include the date in this field.
- meeting_date: ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD). Infer year if missing but prefer pages where the year is explicit.
- source_minutes_url: the full https:// URL of the minutes PDF for that meeting. Must end in .pdf.
- source_video_url: the full https:// URL of the primary YouTube recording for that meeting, or null if no recording is available. If multiple recordings exist for the same meeting (e.g. "Video Recording 1" and "Video Recording 2"), this is the FIRST one.
- additional_video_urls: array of any additional YouTube URLs for the same meeting (segment 2, continuation, retry after stream drop). Empty array if only one recording exists.
- source_id: the source_minutes_url (we use the PDF URL as the canonical dedupe key).

Ignore anything that is not a specific meeting entry (site chrome, navigation, footer links, general "how to attend" instructions, unrelated pages).

Return a JSON array of entries. If the page contains no meeting entries, return [].

STRICT JSON RULES — your response must be machine-parseable:
- Emit ONLY the JSON array. No prose. No markdown fences. No explanation before or after.
- Every string value MUST be a single-line string — no literal newlines inside strings. Use a space instead if needed.
- Every double-quote character that appears inside a string value MUST be escaped as \\" .
- Every backslash inside a string value MUST be escaped as \\\\ .
- No trailing commas after the last element of an array or object.
- Do NOT include any keys not listed above.

Your entire response will be fed to JSON.parse(). If it fails to parse, the run fails.`;

 * array.

<meeting>

</meeting>

The minutes document is attached as a PDF. Use it as the authoritative record of what was discussed and what was decided.

${transcriptBlock}

Produce a chronological list of topic blocks. Each block covers one coherent agenda item or topic of discussion. Keep summaries short and plain-spoken — residents are the audience, not lawyers.

For each block, produce:
- topic_title: a short phrase (under 12 words) naming the topic.
- topic_summary: 1–4 sentences of plain-language summary. Neutral tone. No speculation. If the minutes are unclear or contradict the transcript, say so.
- start_time_seconds: see below.
- action_taken: a single short sentence describing any concrete action, motion, vote, or decision from this block. Null if the block is discussion only.

${videoGuidance}

Aim for 4–12 blocks per meeting. Skip procedural micro-items (call to order, roll call, adjournment, etc.) unless they contain substantive content.

Return a JSON object of the form:
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "topic_title": "...",
      "topic_summary": "...",
      "start_time_seconds": 123,
      "action_taken": "..." | null
    }
  ]
