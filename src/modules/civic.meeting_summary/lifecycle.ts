// civic.meeting_summary module — lifecycle transitions
//
// Meeting summaries follow the same admin-review pattern as civic.brief:
// pending → approved → published. The process-level status starts
// "active" at creation (aggregation has already completed synchronously)
// and jumps to "finalized" on approval publication. This matches the
// brief's documented deviation from Civic Process Spec §6.2 — "closed"
// is skipped because there is no participation window.
