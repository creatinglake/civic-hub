// civic.announcement module — type definitions
//
// Announcements are one-way communications from Board members (or admins)
// to residents. Instant-publish on create: Phase 0 → Phase 6 directly,
// with no framing, activation, participation, aggregation, or outcome.
// Edits are allowed and transparent (edit_count increments, `updated`
// event emitted).
//
// The module is self-contained and portable. The host hub injects the
// event emit function via AnnouncementProcessContext; the module never
// imports the hub's event system directly.

/**
 * Free-form display label for the announcement author. For admins this is
 * always "Admin". For non-admin authors, the label comes from the
 * admin-configured announcement_authors list (hub_settings) and can be
 * any text — "Board member", "Planning Committee", "Guest speaker", etc.
 * Rendered verbatim on the feed post and the public announcement page.
 *
 * Older announcements may still carry "board" as the value (from the
 * Slice 4 union type); the UI treats both "board" and the literal label
 * "Board member" the same way.
