// single shared feed-worthiness classifier.
//
// Phase 3 (audit §2): this file used to be a SECOND, hand-maintained copy of
// the feed's inclusion rules ("MUST STAY IN SYNC with Feed.tsx…") and had
// already drifted — proposals/projects/conversations were absent from the
// digest, civic.process.created was hard-excluded, and every
// civic.process.started was mislabeled as a vote (the wordcloud bug). It now
// delegates to src/shared/feedActivity.ts, the same classifier the web feed
// uses, so the two can never diverge again. Reaching the feed's parity is now
// automatic: anything the feed shows, the digest shows, with the same kind.
