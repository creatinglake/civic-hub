// civic.vote_results module — type definitions
//
// A Vote Results record is a structured summary of a completed vote
// process, intended for delivery to decision-makers (e.g. Board of
// Supervisors) and public publication. Vote results records are
// themselves civic processes — they live in the same process store as
// votes and proposals and follow the spec's lifecycle model
// (Phases 0, 4, 5, 6 per Civic Process Spec §5).
//
// Historical note: this module was originally `civic.brief` (Slice 3).
// Slice 8.5 renamed it to `civic.vote_results` so the user-facing name
// ("Vote results") and the codebase identifier finally match. The
// underlying behavior — admin-reviewed, Board-delivered, then publicly
// published — is unchanged.
//
// This module is self-contained and portable across hubs. The host hub
// provides callbacks for event emission, email delivery, and finalizing
// the linked vote. The module itself has no knowledge of Express, the
// process registry, Supabase, or nodemailer.
