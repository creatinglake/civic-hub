// civic.vote_results module — lifecycle transitions
//
// A vote-results record's lifecycle is narrower than a vote's because it
// doesn't have a participation window. Once created, a vote-results
// record sits in `active` status with publication_status="pending"
// while it awaits admin review. Approval walks it through closed →
// finalized as publication completes.
//
// Process-level status transitions (draft | active | closed | finalized):
//
//   (implicit draft) → active      at creation
//   active → closed                on admin approval (review done)
//   closed → finalized             after email + result_published emit
//
// Publication sub-state (pending | approved | published) mirrors the
// admin workflow more finely than process status alone can.
