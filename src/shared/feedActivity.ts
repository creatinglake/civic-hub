// feedActivity.ts — THE single source of truth for "what is feed-worthy".
//
// Phase 3 of the 2026-06-25 consistency audit (decisions/
// audit-2026-06-25-process-and-feed-consistency.md §2). Before this module,
// the feed-worthiness decision was forked across FOUR drifting copies:
//   1. ui/src/components/Feed.tsx        (kindFromEvent — the inclusion gate)
//   2. ui/src/components/FeedPost.tsx    (eventToPost — the renderer)
//   3. ui/src/components/FeedFilter.tsx  (buildFilterPredicate — the ?type= filter)
//   4. src/modules/civic.digest/filter.ts (isDigestRenderable + classifyItemKind)
// They could not be diffed mechanically (a flat Set vs a data-shape switch)
// and had already drifted — generic "Activity" cards, a wordcloud mislabeled
// as a vote in the digest, proposals/projects/conversations visible in-app but
// absent from email. This module collapses all four into ONE classifier.
//
// SHARED ACROSS BOTH RUNTIMES — consumed by:
//   - the Vite frontend (Feed / FeedPost / FeedFilter), and
//   - the Node backend (civic.digest filter + service).
// It MUST therefore stay framework-agnostic and DEPENDENCY-FREE (no imports).
// Do NOT fork this logic back into the consumers — that drift is the bug this
// module exists to kill. Frontend imports it by relative path; the backend
// gets it via `src/**/*`.
//
// DESIGN — an explicit ALLOWLIST (default-CLOSED). Only event types named here
// produce a feed/digest card; everything else returns null. This is the seam
// for future admin-configurable feed-worthiness (good hardcoded defaults now;
// a config layer can later override the allowlist) and the reason adding
// `data.process.type` to non-feed-worthy emitters (comment_added,
// vote_submitted, moderation, …) does NOT surface them — the field is purely
// a discriminator; visibility is decided here.
//
// DISCRIMINATOR — the `civic.process.<verb>` family (started / result_published
// / created) does not carry the process type in `event_type`; multiple types
// emit the same event_type. We read `data.process.type` (set by every emitter
// via emitEvent) as the single discriminator, falling back to the legacy
// data-shape checks for historical events emitted before the field existed.
